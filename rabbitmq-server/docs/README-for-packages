This is rabbitmq-server, a message broker implementing AMQP, STOMP and MQTT.

Most of the documentation for RabbitMQ is provided on the RabbitMQ web
site. You can see documentation for the current version at:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html

and for previous versions at:

http://www.rabbitmq.com/previous.html

Man pages are installed with this package. Of particular interest are
rabbitmqctl(1), to interact with a running RabbitMQ server, and
rabbitmq-plugins(1), to enable and disable plugins. These should be
run as the superuser.

An example configuration file is provided in the same directory as
this README. Copy it to /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.config to use it. The
RabbitMQ server must be restarted after changing the configuration
file.

An example policy file for HA queues is provided in the same directory
as this README. Copy and chmod +x it to
/usr/local/sbin/set_rabbitmq_policy to use it with the Pacemaker OCF RA.
